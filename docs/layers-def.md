# DEF Layer (Default)

## Overview
The DEF layer is the primary typing layer for everyday text input. It implements Colemak-DH, an ergonomic layout that reduces finger travel and strain compared to QWERTY.

## Access
This is the default layer—always active unless another layer is held.

## Key Map

- **Letters**: Colemak-DH placement (e.g., Q W F P B on top row).
- **Punctuation**: Quotes (single/double), comma, dot, question mark/forward slash on base.
- **Thumbs**: Esc, Tab, Enter, Space, Backspace, Delete for frequent actions.

## Rationale
- **Colemak-DH**: Optimizes for common letter combinations with minimal movement.
- **Base Focus**: Keeps letters uninterrupted; essentials on thumbs for quick access without layer switches.
- **Ergonomics**: Reduces strain by placing punctuation near home row.

## Usage Tips
- Type letters directly; use thumbs for spacing/entering.
- For punctuation, tap base keys or switch to SYM for more options.
